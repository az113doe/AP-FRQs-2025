# Question 3 Analysis

## Competition/Competitor

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

### My initial approach during the exam:

My approach was incompelete during the exam. I had correct loops, initalization, but some logical error in my thought process. More on part(b) then part(a)
for loop solution for part(b)

### My revised solution after review:

Using of while loop on part(b)

### Key concepts tested in this question:

* ArrayList initalization
* ArrayList correct syntax
* Correctly loop
* Both for and while loop

### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

* While loop make a lot more sense for this problem
