# Question 2 Analysis

## Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

### My initial approach during the exam:

Process by reading a part and then coding. Creating the class, instance variable and constructor.
Very direct process of read and code
Using .equals("") instead of length() == 0

### My revised solution after review:

I had revised solutions of length() == 0, as it made more sense with the numbers

### Key concepts tested in this question:

* indexOf()
* substring()
* length()
* if statements
* structures of a class

### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

* .equals("") works for an empty String
* isEmpty() a coded method of java
