# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solution written by **Andy Zou***

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science A exam taken on May 7th 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I found new solutions for certain questions, and fix some mistake I made during the exam itself.

## Preparation

In this section I would describe what I did during the last few days toward the AP exam

* Watching a course review video
* Reading csAwesome
* Reviewing ArrayList
* Reviewing 2D Array

## Exam Experiences

In this section, I will reflect on my feelings and thoughts throughout the exam

* MCQ, I felt a very good pace, and throughout each question, I felt like I was thinking through it all
* Using the time remaining, I quickly went through each question, checking my own confidence level
* FRQ, I felt very good through each question. I was confident for Q1, Q2, Q4. I felt stump at Q3, but manage to pull through
* Using the remaining time I rethought through question 3, trying to secure points. Like writing the for loop

## Growth Opportunites

Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

* ArrayList, it was by far the hardest FRQ for me
* Writing class and method. Overall, I am confident in this topic, but I think I could be even better in this topic

## Future Plans
