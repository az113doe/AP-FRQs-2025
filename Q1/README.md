## Dog Walker
This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures)

### My initial approach

I initially use if, else statements to comepelete the question

### My revised solution after review

My revised solution is simpler, use Math.min()
Thought in the context of the question with comparsion why not focusing on if statement

### Key concepts tested

* Boolean statement
* If statement
* Math class
* Logically comparsions

### What I learned

* Changing perspective
* Simplifying code
