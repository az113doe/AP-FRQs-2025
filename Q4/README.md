# Question 4 Analysis

## Sum/Clear Pairs

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D Arrays):

### My initial approach during the exam:

My solutions for the revised and actual exam is very similar

### My revised solution after review:

It contains fixed logical errors, the loops are better name than what I put on the test for readability
Removing unecessary check of true and false statements. (Lessen reduency)

### Key concepts tested in this question:

* **Understanding of rows and columns**
* 2D arrays sytanx
* loop through a 2D arrays
* Conditional statements

### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

* No need to nested if statements, when you can use signs like || (or) && (and)
